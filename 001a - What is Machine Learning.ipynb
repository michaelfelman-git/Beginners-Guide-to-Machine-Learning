    "**Machine learning** is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms (that iteratively learn from the data) are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects (without being explicitly programmed where to look). These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase, requiring them to assist in the identification of the most relevant business questions and subsequently the data to answer them."

    "Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it‚Äôs worth noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, deep learning is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and neural networks is a sub-field of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required and enabling the use of larger data sets. You can think of deep learning as \"scalable machine learning\". Classical, or \"non-deep\", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn."

    "\"Deep\" machine learning can leverage labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily require a labeled dataset. It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g. text, images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. Unlike machine learning, it doesn't require human intervention to process data, allowing us to scale machine learning in more interesting ways. Deep learning and neural networks are primarily credited with accelerating progress in areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",

    "Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network. The ‚Äúdeep‚Äù in deep learning is just referring to the depth of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers‚Äîwhich would be inclusive of the inputs and the output‚Äîcan be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has two or three layers is just a basic neural network."

Different machine learning algorithms make different assumptions about the shape and structure of the function and how best to optimize a representation to approximate it.
